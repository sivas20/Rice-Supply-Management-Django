    <p>
        The <strong>Rice Supply Chain Management System</strong> is a web-based platform developed by a team of Computer Science students at Aditya College of Engineering & Technology. Our mission is to modernize the traditional rice supply chain by providing a transparent, digital solution that connects farmers, dealers, mill managers, and customers on a single platform.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project addresses the challenges faced in rural rice trading—such as poor pricing transparency, inefficient logistics, and manual transaction records—by introducing a system where stakeholders can interact, negotiate, and transact easily and fairly.
