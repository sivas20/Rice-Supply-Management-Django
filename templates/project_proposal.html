        <div class="section-title">1. Introduction</div>
        <p>
            In Bangladesh and many other agriculture-based countries, the rice supply chain still heavily relies on manual and traditional processes,
            which often lead to inefficiencies, lack of transparency, unfair pricing, and delays in delivery. To address these challenges, our team proposes
            to build a <strong>“Rice Supply Chain Management System”</strong> – a web-based platform that streamlines the entire journey of rice, starting
            from rural farmers all the way to the end customer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our system will connect key stakeholders such as Dealers, Mill Managers, and Customers, with an Admin overseeing the operations. This digital
            platform will ensure better communication, transparency in pricing, fair trade, easier transactions, and efficient delivery.
        </p>

        <div class="section-title">2. Project Objective</div>
        <ul>
            <li>To digitalize and automate the rice supply chain process.</li>
            <li>To provide a platform where dealers and mill managers can easily post and negotiate rice/paddy buying and selling.</li>
            <li>To allow customers to buy rice directly from mill managers.</li>
            <li>To include a mock payment system for secure and traceable transactions.</li>
            <li>To add a transportation agreement system between the parties for smooth logistics handling.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
